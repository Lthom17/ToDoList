# ToDoList

Create a webpage that creates a "To Do" list for the user.  The web page mustmeet the following requirements.
-- Add valid task alerts below the form with JavaScript, placing them within a Bootstrap Grid.
-- The task alerts should have variable width based on the content inside
-- The background color of the task alert is different based upon the number of days.
-- Ensure the Todo List is responsive: The form scales and task alerts wrap as the screen / window size changes.
-- Be able to dismiss / remove the task alerts by clicking the Ã—.
-- Use a date input within the form. 
-- Calculate and display the days remaining compared to the current date.
-- Use "day" or "days" where appropriate
-- Use JavaScript to sort the task alerts by date.

This project was used to prepare me for my Java Cohort beginning Oct. 11th.
